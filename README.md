# challenge-week5-calendar / 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# As a user I want to have a code Work Day Scheduler on business hours.
# When I open the browser, the current day of the week and date should appear.
# When the hour is on past, the color should be grey.
# When I am on the current hour the color line should be red, and the future hours should be green.
# When I click on save buttom the icon should change its size and color using hover commands.
# The color should change as well when the mouse scroll on top of the line red and green (current time and future).
